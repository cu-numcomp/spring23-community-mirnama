## Software: *numpy.polynomial*

*NumPy is a widely used Python package for numerical computations, scientific computing, and 'numpy.polynomial' is 
a subpackage within NumPy that provides tools for working with polynomials.
The 'numpy.polynomial' subpackage includes classes and functions for polynomial manipulation and fitting, 
including the ability to evaluate, differentiate, integrate, and fit polynomials to data. 
It supports univariate and multivariate polynomials and orthogonal polynomials such as Legendre, Chebyshev, and Laguerre polynomials.
In addition to polynomial manipulation, 'numpy.polynomial' includes functions for solving polynomial equations, 
such as 'polyroots' for finding the roots of a polynomial, 'polyint' Computes the indefinite integral of a polynomial.
and 'polydiv' for performing polynomial long division ...etc.*
